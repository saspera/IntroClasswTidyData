# Geog/Envr 250, Day 1 Assignment

Hi class, 

I'm sorry I couldn't be there today but I'm up in Boston presenting some of my work on how deforestation & agricultural expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado may affect regional climate & the future of crop production in Brazil at the American Metereological Society Conference. (Did I assume we had another week of winter break before deciding to prsent at this conference? Yes, yes I did. I'm still not used to how short of a winter break we have here at UR.) But, you're in great hands with Dr. Lookingbill! And I'll be back for class on Wednesday.

You have three tasks to finish in class today, and one short assignment for Wednesday

#### Today
- [ ] Read through the syllabus on Blackboard
- [ ] Go through the assignment on keeping data tidy (see **Monday Assignment** section below) and submit it to Assignments>XXX
- [ ] Fill out [**_this_ short survey**](https://forms.gle/UASqkAGEi8dAfJvF6) 

#### For Wednesday
- [ ] Complete the **short** worksheet that Dr. Lookingbill will hand out, where we all remember how fun math is, which I'll collect at the beginning of class on Wednesday. 

### Monday Assignment
###### Adapted fromm DataCarpentry
One of the major goals of this class is for everyone to leave here with a better understanding of how to collect data, different types of data, and how to ask questions and perform the approprioate statistical analyses on any dataset. So today, we're going to jump right into working with data and use the best practices and pitfall of data organization. If you organize your data in the most 'tidy, it makes data analyis so. much. easier.
